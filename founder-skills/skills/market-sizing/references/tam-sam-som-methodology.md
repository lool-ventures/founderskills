# TAM, SAM, and SOM — Methodology Reference

Reference for the market-sizing agent. Covers definitions, calculation methods, industry examples, and best practices.

## 1. Definitions

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):** The total market demand for a product or service — the maximum revenue opportunity if you achieved 100% market share. TAM represents the entire "pie in the sky" — the total revenue any company could generate if it sold its solution to every potential customer in the market. For a startup, TAM indicates the upper limit of revenue potential and the scale of the opportunity. VCs often want to see a large TAM because a bigger market means more room for a startup to grow into a very large company. Many investors consider markets under ~$1B TAM as too small for venture-scale returns.

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** The portion of the TAM that you can actually target given your business model, geography, or other constraints. It's the "slice" of the TAM pie that your product or service can serve in reality. For example, if your TAM is worldwide but you only operate in one country, that country's market would be your SAM. SAM factors in practical limits like geographic reach, regulatory or industry restrictions, and your specific product focus. SAM is usually smaller than TAM — it tells investors that you understand you can't sell to everyone in the total market and have identified a realistic target segment.

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** The portion of the SAM that you can realistically capture in the near term, often defined as the next 3-5 years. SOM is essentially your initial target market share — what you actually expect to acquire with your current resources and strategy. It's sometimes described as your beachhead or early market share goal. Because SOM reflects short-term, obtainable outcomes, it demonstrates to investors that you have a focused go-to-market plan. For early pitches, SOM can be hypothetical — an estimate of near-term market share — since the startup may not have launched yet.

**Why VCs care:** In early-stage VC, TAM/SAM/SOM are vital to how investors judge the scale and focus of an opportunity. A clear TAM tells VCs the maximum upside if everything goes perfectly. SAM and SOM show that you have a strategic plan: you know your immediate target market and have realistic expectations of capturing a share of it. Early-stage investors prefer to see market size presented as TAM, SAM, and SOM in pitch decks. Later-stage investors focus more on actual revenue growth and realized market traction. In essence, TAM/SAM/SOM indicates to VCs whether a startup can get big enough to deliver venture-sized returns.

## 2. Calculation Methods

### Top-Down Approach

Start from broad industry figures and narrow them down. This method uses high-level research reports or industry-wide data to estimate TAM, then applies filtering criteria to arrive at SAM and SOM.

**Formulas:**
- **TAM** = Total industry revenue (from research reports)
- **SAM** = TAM x Target Segment %
- **SOM** = SAM x Expected Market Share %

**Example:** An industry report says the global enterprise software market is $100B (TAM). Your startup only serves mid-sized businesses (~30%) in North America (~20%). SAM = $100B x 30% x 20% = $6B. Aiming for 5% of SAM: SOM = $6B x 5% = $300M.

**Strengths:** Quick, uses established industry data.
**Weaknesses:** Coarse, relies on broad assumptions. Can be over-optimistic if you assume too large a fraction is reachable.

### Bottom-Up Approach

Build the market size using granular data — your specific product, pricing, and customer assumptions.

**Formulas:**
- **TAM** = Number of potential customers x Average annual revenue per customer
- **SAM** = Serviceable customers x Average annual revenue per customer
- **SOM** = Target customers x Average annual revenue per customer

**Example:** A SaaS product at $15,000/year, 4.5M businesses globally could use it. TAM = 4.5M x $15k = $67.5B. Focus on North American SMBs (35%): SAM = $67.5B x 35% = $23.6B. Capture 0.5% in first years: SOM = $23.6B x 0.5% = ~$118M.

**Strengths:** Data-driven and specific, more credible to investors, grounded in explicit assumptions.
**Weaknesses:** Requires research for accurate inputs (customer counts, realistic pricing).

### Value Theory Approach

For new markets without existing pricing data, estimate how much value customers would ascribe to your solution to infer pricing and market size. Essentially a bottom-up variant where you gauge willingness-to-pay rather than relying on existing prices.

### Cross-Validation

Use both methods where possible. Top-down gives a reality check against industry totals; bottom-up shows assumptions make sense at the ground level. If there's a big mismatch, refine assumptions. The hybrid approach (bottom-up core, top-down corroboration) is most convincing.

## 3. Industry Examples

### B2B SaaS (Project Management Software)
- **TAM:** 4.5M businesses globally x $15k/year = ~$67.5B
- **SAM:** North American SMBs (35%) = ~$23.6B
- **SOM:** 0.5% of SAM with focused marketing = ~$118M
- **Context:** 0.5% share is challenging but not unheard of in fragmented SaaS

### Marketplace (Urban Mobility — EV Scooter Rentals)
- **TAM:** City of 8.8M, ~45% working-age, avg transport spend ~$1.33B/year
- **SAM:** ~30% willing/able to use shared scooters in serviceable zones = ~$167M
- **SOM:** 8% penetration in busiest districts = ~$13.3M
- **Context:** Aggressive for a new mobility service but needed for sustainable local business

### Hardware (Smart Home Devices)
- **TAM:** Global smart home devices market ~$135B
- **SAM:** Tech-savvy urban homeowners in NA/Europe with broadband = ~$40B
- **SOM:** 1% of SAM via retail partnerships and online = ~$400M
- **Context:** 1% is a big goal for hardware but plausible with clear product edge

### Biotech (Novel Therapy for Scoliosis)
- **TAM:** All patients worldwide with scoliosis = ~$5B
- **SAM:** US patients only (FDA approval) = ~$1B
- **SOM:** Top 10 specialist centers in southern US, ~20% of US market = ~$200M
- **Context:** High share feasible by focusing on highest-value segments; depends on clinical data and partnerships

**Key takeaway:** TAM/SAM/SOM numbers vary widely by industry and business model. Each example tailors market sizing to the specific context of the startup. Be prepared to explain how you arrived at each number.

## 4. Best Practices

- **Use credible sources:** Industry research (Gartner, IDC, Statista, IBISWorld), government/trade data, your own early user data. Always cite sources.
- **Prefer bottom-up for accuracy:** Anchor TAM/SAM/SOM with bottom-up grounded in how your business works. Cross-check against top-down.
- **Be clear and specific:** Use simple graphics or tables. Label and quantify each metric with a one-line assumption/method. Don't cram with text.
- **Make assumptions defensible:** A well-justified $500M SAM beats an unsubstantiated $50B TAM. Show your logic at every step.
- **Tie to strategy:** Connect TAM/SAM/SOM to your business plan. SOM should align with hiring, sales capacity, and financial projections.
- **Show segmentation and growth:** Demonstrate you know which segments drive opportunity. Note how SAM could expand over time (new geographies, segments, product lines).
- **Review and update:** Market sizes change. Revisit calculations as your company grows, enters new markets, or launches new products.
- **Avoid two big presentation mistakes:** Don't present a TAM that's too small (VCs question upside) or a SAM that's too large (signals you don't understand the market).
