# VC Investment Committee Dynamics

How real VC Investment Committees work — structure, decision models, and what kills deals. This reference grounds the IC simulation in actual fund mechanics so the simulation produces realistic, useful feedback.

## What Is an Investment Committee?

The IC is the internal forum where a VC fund decides whether to invest. A partner who has been working with a startup "sponsors" the deal and presents it to the other partners for debate and decision. The founder is not present — this is the conversation that happens behind closed doors.

## Common IC Formats

### The Classic Round Table (Most Common)
- 3-5 partners sit around a table (or video call)
- Sponsoring partner presents (15-20 min)
- Open discussion and Q&A (20-40 min)
- Decision: invest, pass, or request more diligence
- Most seed/Series A funds use this format

### The Memo-First Model
- Sponsoring partner writes a detailed investment memo before the meeting
- Partners read it in advance
- Discussion is focused on disagreements and open questions
- Common at larger, more institutional funds (a16z, Sequoia)

### The Conviction Model
- One partner can champion a deal with strong personal conviction
- IC discussion focuses on "why not" rather than "why"
- Other partners can object but the bar for blocking is higher
- Common at smaller funds where partners have concentrated ownership

## Decision Models

### Unanimous Consent
- All partners must agree to invest
- Any single partner can kill a deal
- Creates conservative portfolio — fewer bets, higher conviction
- Most common at small funds (2-4 partners)

### Majority Vote
- Simple or supermajority (2/3) vote required
- Allows one dissenting partner
- More deals get through, slightly lower average conviction
- Common at larger funds with 5+ partners

### Champion Model
- Sponsoring partner decides, others advise
- IC is a stress-test, not a vote
- Highest throughput but requires deep partner trust
- Common at solo GP funds or very early-stage

## What Happens in the Room

### Phase 1: The Pitch (Sponsor Presents)
The sponsoring partner acts as the founder's advocate. They present:
1. **The opportunity** — market, timing, why this company
2. **The team** — founder-market fit, execution evidence
3. **The business** — traction, unit economics, competitive position
4. **The deal** — terms, round size, who else is in, valuation context
5. **The risks** — honest assessment of what could go wrong
6. **The ask** — how much to invest, at what terms

### Phase 2: The Interrogation
Other partners ask questions. These fall into patterns:
- **Thesis alignment** — "Does this fit what we said we'd invest in?"
- **Competitive landscape** — "Who else is doing this? Why will this team win?"
- **Market reality** — "Is this market as big as presented? What's the real TAM?"
- **Economic viability** — "Do the unit economics work at scale?"
- **Risk assessment** — "What kills this company? What's the single point of failure?"
- **Portfolio fit** — "Do we already have something adjacent? Would this create conflict?"

### Phase 3: The Debate
Partners argue their positions. Common dynamics:
- The **market bull** vs. the **execution skeptic**
- The partner who loves the founder vs. the one who questions the business model
- The "I've seen this movie before" pattern matcher vs. the "this time is different" optimist
- Portfolio construction tension: "We already have X, do we need Y?"

### Phase 4: The Decision
- Explicit decision: invest, pass, or conditional (more diligence needed)
- If invest: terms discussion, ownership target, board seat allocation
- If pass: whether to stay in touch or hard pass
- If more diligence: specific questions/requirements with deadline

## What Kills Deals at IC

### Instant Deal-Killers
1. **Portfolio conflict** — Existing investment in same space, customer overlap
2. **Integrity concerns** — Founder misrepresented data, numbers don't check out
3. **Single point of failure** — Entire business depends on one customer, one regulation, one patent
4. **Adverse reference** — Someone in the network had a negative experience with the founder

### Common Slow Deaths
1. **"Interesting but not now"** — Market timing concerns, no urgency
2. **"Good team, wrong market"** — Impressive founders building in a small or shrinking market
3. **"Math doesn't work"** — Unit economics that require miracles to work at scale
4. **"No moat"** — Nothing preventing a well-funded competitor from copying the approach
5. **"We'd need to see more"** — Traction is promising but not yet convincing for the stage

## Stage-Specific IC Expectations

### Pre-Seed IC
- **Focus:** Team > vision > early signal
- **Key question:** "Are these the founders to solve this problem?"
- **Evidence bar:** Low — conviction is about people and insight, not data
- **Typical deal-killers:** Weak founding team, unclear problem-solution fit, non-differentiated approach

### Seed IC
- **Focus:** Product-market fit signals > team > market
- **Key question:** "Is there evidence that customers want this?"
- **Evidence bar:** Medium — early traction (LOIs, waitlist, pilot revenue), clear ICP, working product
- **Typical deal-killers:** No customer evidence, bloated burn, unfocused GTM

### Series A IC
- **Focus:** Repeatable GTM > unit economics > scale path
- **Key question:** "Can this become a big, efficient business?"
- **Evidence bar:** High — $1M+ ARR, healthy cohorts, repeatable sales motion, clear path to profitability
- **Typical deal-killers:** Leaky cohorts, unclear CAC/LTV, no repeatable sales motion, overpriced round

## How Partners Prepare

Before IC, each partner typically:
1. Reads the investment memo or deal summary
2. Reviews the startup's pitch deck and data room
3. Checks for portfolio conflicts
4. Talks to 1-2 references (customers, industry experts, former colleagues of the founders)
5. Forms an initial view: excited, skeptical, or neutral
6. Prepares 2-3 key questions they want answered in the discussion

## What Founders Should Know

1. **Your sponsor is your advocate** — They've already decided they want to invest. The IC is about convincing the others.
2. **Partners have different lenses** — One cares about market size, another about unit economics, another about team. Address all lenses.
3. **The discussion you don't hear matters most** — What partners say to each other about your startup reveals the real objections. This simulation helps you hear that conversation.
4. **Every concern maps to an action** — A good IC simulation doesn't just identify problems, it shows you what to prepare, what to address proactively, and what to have ready for Q&A.
5. **Consensus is rare** — In real ICs, 2-1 decisions are common. Unanimous enthusiasm is the exception. If the simulation shows some skepticism, that's realistic, not a bad sign.
